An application for offline and online using localstorage with lawnchair
===================================

In this repository I'm going to create an offline application that uses backbone, lawnchair and consume an api and works in online and offline mode

#### I want to use the following technologies:

- Backbone.js
- Html 5 and boostrap
- Lawnchair for localstorage using Dom as adapter
- Backend using Ruby on Rails or Cakephp using an API
- Manifiest cache (When there is no conection)
